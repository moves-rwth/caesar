# JANI Types for Rust

This crate implements Rust types for the *jani-model* format from the [JANI project](https://jani-spec.org/).
It is an interchange format for quantitative model checking problems (but can do much more).
We mostly just the [*jani-model* specification](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BDQIzPBtscxJFFlDUEPIo8ivKHgXT8_X6hz5quq7jK0/edit) for this implementation.
