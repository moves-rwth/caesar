It builds on modern SMT solvers to automatically check if probabilistic programs conform to their specification. This high degree of automation sometimes comes at the cost of brittle verification. Seemingly unrelated changes in the input program can cause the verifier to hang and verification to fail. These instabilities are often caused by quantifiers that are used in axioms to describe the relevant theories for verification. A common problem here are matching loops - an ill-behaved set of quantifiers that can cause an infinite number of quantifier instantiations by themselves. A large contributor of matching loops are user-defined recursive functions. A common approach taken by other verifiers is to encode such functions as limited functions, limiting the number of recursive instantiations and avoiding matching loops by construction. While they have been proven to be effective, there is little information available about them and they lacked a formal treatment. We present and formally define different limited function encodings used by other verifiers, and subsequently prove that these transformations are sound. Furthermore, we examine how one of the encodings can be modified to obtain finite and constructible counterexamples involving recursive functions. The presented encodings are implemented in Caesar. We provide guidance on the subtleties that are required for the encodings to work well in practice.

Theoretical verification of key properties (positive almost-sure termination, success probability, and the expectation of the number of failed and sent transmissions) was largely successful using weakest preexpectation calculus. Translating these results into verification using Caesar introduced practical challenges, particularly in invariant discovery. Additionally, even valid invariants did not always lead to successful verification due to limitations in Caesar\u2019s current implementation, particularly in SMT solver performance and the handling of exponentials. However, through workarounds including alternative invariants and a 'fueled' exponential function, meaningful properties of BRP were verified.
