# The Deductive Verifier *Caesar* for VSCode

This is the VSCode extension for the [Caesar deductive verifier](https://www.caesarverifier.org).
Caesar is a verifier for probabilistic and quantitative programs and thus supports reasoning about quantitative specifications such as "the expected runtime is at most `2x`".
Caesar uses the *HeyVL* language as its quantitative *intermediate verification language* (IVL).
This VSCode extension recognizes the `.heyvl` file extension.

You can find more information about Caesar and HeyVL on the website: https://www.caesarverifier.org/.

On the website, you can also download the Caesar command-line binary for more advanced use cases that are not included in this VSCode extension.

The extension will open a walkthrough on first startup to guide you through the installation.

If this does not happen for you after installation, you can open the guide with the command `Caesar: Show Getting Started`.
The command palette can be opened with Shift + Command + P (Mac) / Ctrl + Shift + P (Windows/Linux).

## Features

 * Diagnostics such as errors or warnings are shown in the code and in the "Problems" menu in VSCode.
 * Inline explanations of computed verification conditions.
 * Automatic installation and updating of Caesar.
