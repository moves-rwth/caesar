//! This module contains code to select statements for slicing.
//!
//! The basic notion is the [`SliceEffect`], which relates a statements' removal
//! to its effect on verification or counter-examples of a program.
//!
//! A [`SliceSelection`] filters which kinds of statements to slice (e.g. by
//! their [`SliceEffect`]), and also might include messages to print when a
//! statement is sliced. The selection and associated messages can be given by
//! [`SliceAnnotation`]s, which are available to the user as well.
//!
//!  The [`SelectionBuilder`] can be used to build selections during an AST
//! traversal.
