# Introduction

Hello and welcome!
This is the user documentation for [_Caesar_](https://github.com/moves-rwth/caesar), a deductive verification framework for probabilistic programs.

### Overview

After [installing Caesar](./getting-started/installation.mdx), continue with our [getting started guide](./getting-started/) to learn the basics of HeyVL and Caesar.

The language is documented in the [HeyVL language section](./heyvl/).
Built-in functions and types are documented in the [standard library section](./stdlib/).

In the [Caesar section](./caesar/), we have documentation for the Caesar tool, its command-line interface and the VSCode extension, as well as for our slicing algorithm.

### Our Theory Paper

We have an OOPSLA 2023 paper on Caesar and its theory: [_A Deductive Verification Infrastructure for Probabilistic Programs_](https://doi.org/10.1145/3622870).
You can [find the preprint on arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07781).
More information on the [publications page](./publications.md).
