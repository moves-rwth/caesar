# Development Guide

This guide explains how Caesar and related tools work internally and how to contribute to the code.

The whole project currently lives in a GitHub repository: [`github.com/moves-rwth/caesar`](https://github.com/moves-rwth/caesar).
We use GitHub's issue tracker.

## Caesar

[Caesar's](./caesar)'s source code is begins at the root level of the Git repository.
It is a [cargo workspace](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch14-03-cargo-workspaces.html) containing the main `caesar` crate and the `z3rro` crate.

We try to use [rustdoc](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustdoc/what-is-rustdoc.html) as much as possible to document how `caesar` works.
Just run `cargo doc --open` to build and open the Rust API documentation of the project.

To run all tests, execute `cargo test --all`.

The source code for the `caesar` crate lives in [`src/`](https://github.com/moves-rwth/caesar/tree/master/src).

Integration tests live in the [`tests/`](https://github.com/moves-rwth/caesar/tree/master/tests) directory.
Read the associated [`tests/README.md`](https://github.com/moves-rwth/caesar/blob/master/tests/README.md) for more information about these tests.

`z3rro` is our dedicated crate for basic SMT functionality.
It lives in [`z3rro/`](https://github.com/moves-rwth/caesar/tree/master/z3rro).
The idea is that this code is independent of Caesar itself and may be useful to other projects.

## pgcl2heyvl

`pgcl2heyvl` is our [pGCL frontend](./pgcl.md).
It lives in [`pgcl/pgcl2heyvl`](https://github.com/moves-rwth/caesar/tree/main/pgcl/pgcl2heyvl).
The tool is written in Python and we use [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for its dependency management.
The most important dependency is [`probably`](https://github.com/Philipp15b/probably) which defines the accepted pGCL syntax.

The tool has a terrible user interface (need to specify invariants as command-line arguments!) and `pgcl2heyvl` is being phased out (see [its documentation](./pgcl.md)) in favor of integration of the encodings directly in Caesar.

## Website

The documentation you are reading right now is built using [Docosaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) and lives in the [`website`](https://github.com/moves-rwth/caesar/tree/main/website) directory.

You can install it using `yarn` or `npm`: Run `yarn` or `npm install`.

Then either run `yarn start` or `npm run start` to start a local development server and open the site in a browser window.
