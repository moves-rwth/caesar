# Installing Caesar

Caesar can be used through our VSCode extension and as a command-line application.
The required Caesar binary can be downloaded automatically by the VSCode extension.
You can also [download binaries manually](#download-binaries), [pull a Docker image](#download-docker), or [build locally from source](#build-source).

```mdx-code-block
import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';
import Link from '@docusaurus/Link';
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
```

## Option A: Download Caesar Verifier for VSCode (Recommended)

</Link>

Our *Caesar Verifier for VSCode* extension is the recommended way to install Caesar.
The extension can automatically download and update the pre-built releases of Caesar.

The extension is available in the VSCode and VSCodium extension marketplaces and can be installed by searching for *Caesar Verifier*.

<Link class="button button--primary" to="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rwth-moves.caesar">Go to Caesar Verifier on VSCode Marketplace</Link>

<br /><br />

**Features:**
 * Syntax highlighting and language configuration for HeyVL.
 * Snippets for HeyVL.
 * Verify HeyVL files on file save or on command.
 * Verification errors and successes are shown in the gutter via icons.
 * Diagnostics such as errors or warnings are shown in the code and in the "Problems" menu in VSCode.
 * Inline explanations of computed verification conditions.
 * Automatic installation and updating of Caesar.

**Installation:**
After installing the extension in VSCode, a getting started page will open from where you can install the Caesar binaries (open manually with `Caesar: Open Getting Started` command).

## Options B: Download Pre-Built Releases

If you do not want to use the automatic installation from our VSCode extension, you can download Caesar manually.

### Option B.1: Pre-Built Binary {#download-binaries}

1. Go to the [latest stable release on GitHub](https://github.com/moves-rwth/caesar/releases/latest) (or [latest nightly release](https://github.com/moves-rwth/caesar/releases/nightly)) and download the release for your operating system.

2. Extract the `caesar` binary from the downloaded archive.

3. <div>

  <p style={{marginBottom: "0"}}>
    On MacOS, you may have to <Link to="https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/mh40616/mac">release the binary from quarantine</Link> to allow execution.
  </p>

  ```bash
  # Execute in the extracted folder
  xattr -d com.apple.quarantine ./caesar
  ```

  </small>
  </div>

<div style={{ paddingTop: "1em" }} />

### Option B.2: Docker Image {#download-docker}

We also provide a [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) image ([multi-platform](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-platform/) targeting `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`).

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/moves-rwth/caesar:latest
```

You can use this Docker image just like the `caesar` binary.
To access files from your system you need to mount them as volumes.
For example, if you want to verify a program in `./programs/example.heyvl`, the following command mounts the `./programs/` directory as `/root/caesar/programs/` inside the container and uses `caesar` to verify `example.heyvl`.

```bash
docker run -it -v $PWD/programs:/root/caesar/programs/ ghcr.io/moves-rwth/caesar:latest /root/caesar/programs/example.heyvl
```

<div style={{ paddingTop: "3em" }} />

## Options C: Build From Source {#build-source}

### Option C.1: Compile Binary

#### Installing Dependencies

You will need to install some dependencies manually:

**Rust:** To install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), we recommend [installation via rustup](https://rustup.rs/).
You might need to restart your terminal after installing Rust.

**Build Tools:** Caesar builds [Z3](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3) itself, so we need [Python](https://www.python.org) and [cmake](https://cmake.org/).

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
  <TabItem value="mac" label="macOS">

  1. Install Rust via rustup:
    ```bash
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
    ```
  2. Install Python and CMake using the package manager [Homebrew](https://brew.sh):
    ```bash
    brew install python cmake
    ```

</TabItem>
  <TabItem value="debian" label="Debian/Linux">

  1. Install Rust via rustup:
    ```bash
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
    ```
  2. Install Python, CMake, LLVM, Clang and LLD using `apt`:
    ```bash
    apt install python3 cmake llvm-dev libclang-dev clang lld
    ```

</TabItem>
  <TabItem value="win" label="Windows">

  1. [Follow the instructions](https://rustup.rs/) to install Rust via rustup.
  2. Install Python, CMake and LLVM using the package manager [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install):
    ```bash
    choco install python cmake llvm
    ```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Compiling Caesar

1. Clone the [Git repository](https://github.com/moves-rwth/caesar):
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/moves-rwth/caesar.git
  cd caesar
  ```
2. Build `caesar` using [cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/):
  ```bash
  cargo install --path . caesar
  ```
  Because this will compile a large number of dependencies, this might take a couple of minutes (especially Z3 takes some time).
  Using `cargo install` makes `caesar` available on the command-line.

Then, you can run an example:
```bash
caesar tests/zeroconf.heyvl
```
And this will print:
```
tests/zeroconf.heyvl::arp: Verified.
tests/zeroconf.heyvl::zeroconf: Verified.
```

<div style={{ paddingTop: "1em" }} />

### Option C.2: Build Docker Image

We also support building a Docker image.
This does not require installing dependencies and will build and package the `caesar` binary in a Docker image.

1. Clone the [Git repository](https://github.com/moves-rwth/caesar):
  ```bash
  git clone git@github.com:moves-rwth/caesar.git
  cd caesar
  ```
2. Build the Docker image, named `caesar`, using [docker build](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/image/build/):
  ```bash
  docker build -t caesar -f docker/Dockerfile .
  ```

  :::note Multi-platform image

    You can build and load a [multi-platform image](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-platform) using [docker buildx](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/buildx/build/):
    ```bash
    docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 -t caesar -f docker/Dockerfile . --load
    ```

  :::

With the Docker image `caesar` built, you can use it just like the `caesar` binary.
To access files from your system you need to mount them as volumes.
For example, if you want to verify a program in `./programs/example.heyvl`, the following command mounts the `./programs/` directory as `/root/caesar/programs/` inside the container and uses `caesar` to verify `example.heyvl`.

```bash
docker run -it -v $PWD/programs:/root/caesar/programs/ caesar /root/caesar/programs/example.heyvl
```
