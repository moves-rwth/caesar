# Guide to HeyVL

```mdx-code-block
import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';
import Link from '@docusaurus/Link';
```

After [installing Caesar](./installation.mdx), we can start to use HeyVL with Caesar.
In this guide, we'll go through the basics of HeyVL and how verification problems can be encoded in it.
We'll use the *lossy list* example from our [home page](/) to understand HeyVL.
On the next page, we present [a collection of HeyVL examples](./zoo-of-heyvl-examples.md).

## What are HeyVL and Caesar?

### Architecture

</figure>

On the right, you can see the architecture of Caesar.
Caesar is designed as a _deductive verification infrastructure_ for probabilistic programs.

At the core is _HeyVL_, our _intermediate verification language_ (IVL).
An IVL is used to encode a wide range of verification problems and verification techniques into a common language.
In contrast to normal programming languages, IVLs can feature statements such as `assert` and `assume`.
Intuitively, `assert` checks a condition and fails if it's not true.
`assume` lets us make a logical assumption at arbitrary points in the program.
These can be used to encode proofs and proof rules into the IVL.
HeyVL is a _quantitative_ IVL, meaning that its verification statements (`assert`, `assume`, `havoc`...) do not only reason about Boolean statements (`x = 3`), but rather about quantities such as expected values (`[x = 3] * 0.5`).

The _verification condition generator_ (VC generator) takes a HeyVL program and converts it to _verification conditions_, which is a logical formula in our quantative logic *HeyLo*.
This formula specifies logically whether a HeyVL program verifies or not.
For example, `assume [x = 3]; assert 0.5` is converted to the HeyLo formula `[x = 3] â†’ 0.5`.
We will explain what this means later in this guide (see the section on [verification statements](#verification-statements)).
At the end, Caesar converts the HeyLo formula into a problem for an *SMT solver*; currently we use [Z3](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3).
This allows us to check whether a program verifies *for all possible inputs*.
If verification fails, then the SMT solver can often return a counter-example, i.e. an input to the program so that the program does not verify.

Caesar supports a number of proof rules out of the box (see [proof rules documentation](../proof-rules/)).
For example, reasoning about *while loops* or recursion is done through proof rules.
By adding an annotation such as [`@invariant`](../proof-rules/induction.md) to a while loop, you can instruct Caesar use the *Park induction* proof rule.
However, this will internally desugar into normal HeyVL code which means these proof rules are *not* magic built-ins, but just a convenience in Caesar.
Thus, you can add your own proof rules with Caesar by encoding them in HeyVL.
That is the advantage of using an intermediate verification language such as HeyVL.

:::info

The language HeyVL and the basics of Caesar are formally described in our [OOPLSA '23 publication _"A Deductive Verification Infrastructure for Probabilistic Programs"_](../publications.md#oopsla-23) ([direct link to extended version pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.07781.pdf)).
There, you can find rock-solid formal foundations for HeyVL and details on how to prove that HeyVL programs are *correct*, i.e. actually encode the desired verification problems.
We highly recommend you take a look at it after reading this guide for a more rigorous treatment of HeyVL and Caesar.
Refer to our [publications page](../publications.md#oopsla-23) for more details.

### Features

So, what can we do with HeyVL and Caesar right now?
Here's an incomplete list of features:

* Prove correctness and find bugs in probabilistic programs.
    * We have verified properties like lower and upper bounds on expected values, such as expected values on termination, expected runtimes, expected resource consumption, termination probabilities, and more.
    * Using proof rules like Park induction, k-induction, rules for positive almost-sure and almost-sure termination, or the optional stopping theorem.
* Use *HeyVL*, a *quantitative* intermediate verification language that
    * has generalized quantitative verification statements `assume`, `assert`, `havoc`, and nondeterministic choice,
    * features dual *co*-versions of verification statements to reason about *upper bounds* of expected values (the non-`co` statements are used to reason about *lower bounds*),
    * and through these allows you to encode new proof rules and use Caesar as a verifier for them.
* Leverage the power of modern SMT solvers to logically reason about infinite-state probabilistic systems with infinitely many inputs and outputs, and unbounded loops and recursion.
* Compositionally reason about programs, building bigger verified programs out of smaller verified parts using procedures.
* Define your own data types and define new functions in HeyVL, with support for *uninterpreted* definitions, i.e. those defined by logical *axioms* and thus may not even have an executable definition.
* Formally correct reasoning with theoretical guarantees. We do not use sampling algorithms such as [MCMC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo), but instead use logical reasoning about programs.


## Verifying Our First Program: Lossy List Traversal

Let us now go through the lossy list example in detail and step-by-step.
The [full example can be found below](#full-example).

### The Probabilistic Program Itself

Let us start with the probabilistic program itself, without any HeyVL annotations.
`lossy_list` is a procedure that takes an input `init_L` of type `List` and returns an output list `l`.
`List` is a user-defined type [which we define below](#user-defined-datatypes-and-functions).

```heyvl
proc lossy_list(init_l: List) -> (l: List)
{
    l = init_l
    while len(l) > 0 {
        var prob_choice: Bool = flip(0.5)
        if prob_choice {
            l = pop(l)
        } else {
            assert [false]
        }
    }
}
```

The program is supposed to model a list traversal with a (rather alarming) 50% probability of memory faults during the traversal.
For this guide, we want to prove a lower bound to the probability of a successful traversal.

#### What does the program do?

1. We initialize the output `l` to the input.
Note that it's forbidden in HeyVL to modify input variables.
2. The main part of the code is the `while` loop.
It runs as long as the list `l` is not zero.

   1. In the loop body, we have our *probabilistic statement*: The `flip(0.5)` expression does a coin flip and returns `true` or `false`, each with probability `0.5`.
   The result is saved in a newly declared variable `prob_choice` using the `var` statement.
   When we declare a new variable in HeyVL, we always need to specify the type.

   2. If the coin flip resulted in `true`, then we remove the first element of the top of the list using `pop`.
   The resulting list has a length that's one smaller than before.

   3. If the coin flip resulted in `false`, then we simulate a memory fault using `assert [false]`.

   4. <small>Note: In HeyVL, while loops always need invariant annotations. Therefore, this program is not yet valid HeyVL code. We'll add the annotation <Link to="#specifications">when we talk about specifications</Link>.</small>

3. HeyVL does not have `return` statements. Every value to be returned by the procedure must be declared as an output variable in the procedure declaration. Here, the output variable `l` is automatically returned.

There is more detailed documentation on HeyVL's [procedures](../heyvl/procs.md) and [statements](../heyvl/statements.md).

#### What do we want to verify?

With Caesar, various properties of this program can be verified:

 * **In this guide, we'll only verify that he probability of a successful run without crashing is at least `0.5^len(init_l)`.**
 * We could verify probabilities of crashing at specific list lengths.
 * We could verify expected values of list lengths at crash time.
 * For the above, we can verify either *lower* or *upper bounds*.
 * The program is *certainly terminating*, i.e. each execution will always terminate in a finite number of steps.
    * There are programs that only terminate with probability one, but may have a zero probability of not terminating. We call these programs *almost-surely terminating* (*AST* for short).
    * There are programs which terminate with probability one, but do not have a finite expected runtime. Such programs are almost-surely terminating, but not *positively almost-surely terminating* (*PAST* for short).
 * ... and many more.

### User-Defined Datatypes and Functions

Our probbabilistic program above is incomplete: it's still missing a specification and a loop invariant annotation.
In addition, the `List` type and the `exp` function need to be defined.
They are not built-in into HeyVL, but must be *axiomatized* using user-defined domains and functions.

How this works is that domains and functions are defined *uninterpreted*, which means that they do not necessarily need to have a complete executable definition associated with them.
Domains are simply new types which functions can map from and into.
Functions simply have input and output types.

Then, *axioms* define the knowledge that Caesar (and the underlying SMT solver) will receive about these uninterpreted domains and functions.
For the purpose of verification, we check all possible definitions which satisfy these axioms and ignore those that do not satisfy them.

#### The List Type

Let's declare our list type, using the [built-in `UInt` type](../stdlib/numbers.md#uint) for nonnegative integers.
```heyvl
domain List {
    func len(l: List): UInt
    func pop(l: List): List

    axiom list_pop forall l: List. len(pop(l)) == len(l) - 1
}
```

You will notice that we do not declare what a list consists or what size the data type should have.
We simply declare a domain `List` and have two uninterpreted functions `len` and `pop` operating on this type.
They also don't have definitions, but only the axiom `list_pop` that says the length will decrease by one if we run `pop` on a list `l`.

These uninterpreted definitions are part of the magic of deductive verification using SMT solving that Caesar does.
We can simply define new types and functions *logically* via a (possibly partial) specification and verify with those.
This makes Caesar very extensible: new definitions do not need to be baked into Caesar itself, but can be defined by the user.
This makes axioms also extremely dangerous. Consider `axiom my_wrong_axiom false`.
Because `false` is never true for any interpretation, verification with this axiom will always succeed!

#### The Exponential Function

Remember that we want to prove a lower bound of `0.5^len(init_l)` for the probability of a run without crashing.
Exponential functions are also not included in Caesar, but it can also be easily added.

```heyvl
domain Exponentials {
    func exp(base: UReal, exponent: UInt): UReal

    axiom exp_base forall base: UReal. exp(base, 0) == 1
    axiom exp_step forall base: UReal, exponent: UInt. exp(base, exponent + 1) == base * exp(base, exponent)
}
```

We declare a domain `Exponentials`.
The new type `Exponentials` is not used, but all function definitions and axioms need a surrounding `domain`.
The function `exp` takes a base and an exponent of type `UReal` and `UInt`, respectively.
See the [number types docs](../stdlib/numbers.md) for more information.

There are two axioms for `exp`.
The first, `exp_base` specifies that `exp(base, 0) == 1` holds for all `base` values.
The second, `exp_step` specifies the successive cases, `exp(base, exponent + 1) == base * exp(base, exponent)`.

You might wonder why we specify the exponential function in this inductive way and not via the [many other definitions of the exponential function that Wikipedia provides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characterizations_of_the_exponential_function).
After all, we are not restricted to inductively computable definitions and can use any logical specification we want, right?
The answer here is that those two axioms are precisely the ones needed to prove our specific property using our chosen proof rule of [Park induction](../proof-rules/induction.md).
We'll see this below.
In general, what axioms you need to provide for verification is often specific to the verification task at hand.

Refer to the [documentation on domains and functions](../heyvl/domains.md) for more information.

### Specifications and Invariants

Now that we have provided all necessary definitions for the program, let us write the specification.
Remember that we want to verify that the probability of a successful run without crashing is at least `exp(0.5, len(init_l))`.
How do we specify such a property in HeyVL?

HeyVL uses *expectation-based reasoning*, which is a kind of deductive reasoning that talks about expected values of random variables.
We describe the full theoretical details in our [OOPSLA '23 publication](../publications.md#oopsla-23).
For now though, we'll provide some intuition.

#### Specifications

We extend our `lossy_list` declaration as follows with a `pre` and a `post` attribute:
```heyvl
proc lossy_list(init_l: List) -> (l: List)
    pre [len(init_l) == 1] * 0.5
    post [true]
{ ... }
```
What does this mean?
Expectation-based reasoning always works backwards through the program.
Accordingly, we start our interpretation with the `post`.
The procedure having the post `[true]` means that we are ultimately interested in reasoning about the *expected value of `[true]` at termination*.
The Iverson bracket notation `[b]` maps a Boolean expression `b` to `1` if `b` evaluates to `true` and to `0` otherwise.
Therefore, `[true]` is equivalent to `1`.
It follows that `post [true]` means we are interested simply in the probability of successful termination.

The pre `[len(init_l) == 1] * 0.5` is a bit more interesting.
It results in a *proof obligation* for Caesar: the verifier now needs to show that *the pre is always a lower bound to the expected value of the post*.
The pre evaluates to `0.5` in case the length of the list is exactly one and to zero otherwise.
Since the pre is checked as a lower bound (and expected values are nonnegative in HeyVL), Caesar in effect only checks that `0.5` is a lower bound for inputs with list length equal to one.

Of course, we can also change the pre so that Caesar has to check infinitely many inputs, e.g. by changing the pre to `[len(init_l) != 1] * exp(0.5, len(init_l))`.
Thanks to the magic of deductive reasoning and SMT solvers, this will also work instantly.

#### Invariants and Other Proof Rules {#invariants}

Verification of programs with loops might require reasoning about an unbounded, possibly infinite number of loop iterations.
In deductive verification, we reduce reasoning of programs with loops to HeyVL programs without loops.
This is done using various *proof rules*.

In the non-probabilistic setting, the most famous one is the [proof rule from Hoare logic (for partial correctness)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoare_logic#While_rule) which says that if we have an *invariant* for a loop, i.e. a formula that holds before the loop and is maintained during the loop body's execution, then we may conclude that the invariant holds after the loop as well.
There is a direct correspondence to this rule in the probabilistic setting.
We call this rule [Park induction](../proof-rules/induction.md).

To prove the desired pre being a lower bound on the expected value, we need find a *probabilistic invariant* `I`, i.e. an expression that computes an expected value for every program state, such that

 1. If the loop condition is true, then `I` must be a lower bound to the expected value of `I` itself at the end of each single loop iteration,
 2. If the loop condition is false, then `I` must be a lower bound to the post (in this case it's `[true] = 1`).

Note: There is a more formal description on the <Link to="../proof-rules/induction">documentation page for the Park induction proof rule</Link>.

This proof rule corresponds to the general proof method of mathematical induction.
The base case is (2) when the loop condition is false and the inductive case is (1) when the loop condition is true, where we only reason about a single loop iteration.

So what is a valid invariant for our program?
It turns out that `exp(0.5, len(l))` is a valid invariant:

 1. If the loop condition is true, then the expected value of `exp(0.5, len(l))` at the end of the loop iteration is exactly `I`! Here's the calculation:
    ```
      0.5 * exp(0.5, len(pop(l))) + 0.5 * 0
    = 0.5 * exp(0.5, len(pop(l)))            (simplify)
    = 0.5 * exp(0.5, len(l)-1)               (list_pop axiom)
    = exp(0.5, len(l))                       (exp_step axiom)
    ```
 2. If the loop condition is false, then `I` is `exp(0.5, 0)` which is equivalent to `1` by the `exp_base` axiom.

Caesar has built-in support for Park induction with the [`@invariant` annotation for loops](../proof-rules/induction.md).
We add it on top of a loop statement:
```heyvl
@invariant(exp(0.5, len(l)))
while len(l) > 0 { ... }
```

This is all we needed to do before we can verify this program.
Before we do so, a warning.

:::caution

HeyVL is an intermediate verification language and proof rules like Park induction must only be applied where it is sound with respect to the language semantics that we are considering.
In this case, by using Park induction in a `proc`, we implicitly assumed *greatest fixed point* semantics on unbounded non-negative expected values for the loop.
It assigns an infinite expected value to nonterminating executions.
Then, Park induction is sound for lower bound reasoning only.

A more common choice is *least fixed point* semantics for loops, which assigns zero to nonterminating executions.
There, Park induction is sound only for *upper bound reasoning* ([see below](#upper-bounds)).

Refer to the [proof rules documentation](../proof-rules/) for more information on soundness of proof rules.

### Running the Complete Example {#full-example}

We can now run Caesar on the full example file.
This file is also available in the [Github repository](https://github.com/moves-rwth/caesar) at `tests/domains/lossy_list.heyvl`.

```heyvl
domain Exponentials {
    func exp(base: UReal, exponent: UInt): UReal

    axiom exp_base forall base: UReal. exp(base, 0) == 1
    axiom exp_step forall base: UReal, exponent: UInt. exp(base, exponent + 1) == base * exp(base, exponent)
}

domain List {
    func len(l: List): UInt
    func pop(l: List): List

    axiom list_pop forall l: List. len(pop(l)) == len(l) - 1
}

proc lossy_list(init_l: List) -> (l: List)
    pre [len(init_l) == 1] * 0.5
    post [true]
{
    l = init_l
    @invariant(exp(0.5, len(l)))
    while len(l) > 0 {
        var prob_choice: Bool = flip(0.5)
        if prob_choice {
            l = pop(l)
        } else {
            assert [false]
        }
    }
}
```

To verify this example using Caesar, simply run the following command in the Caesar source directory:
```bash
caesar verify tests/domains/lossy_list.heyvl
```

### Reasoning About Upper Bounds (Coprocedures) {#upper-bounds}

In this example, we are reasoning about *lower bounds* of expected values.
In classical non-probabilistic deductive verification, reasoning about lower bounds of truth values is the default and sufficient for most tasks (the recent interest in *incorrectness logics* being a trend to the opposite).
In probabilistic, expectation-based reasoning though, it is just as natural to reason about upper bounds of expected values as about lower bounds.
For example, we'd like to prove an upper bound to the probability of a crash. <small>This is not simply the opposite probability to the probability of a successful run when we also distinguish nontermination from crashes (we do!).</small>

HeyVL supports reasoning about upper bounds as well, via its `coproc`s.
A `coproc` is just like a `proc`, but the `pre` annotation is interpreted differently.
Instead of noting a *lower bound* on the expected value of the post, it now denotes an *upper bound* of the post.
The `co` prefix indicates that the declaration is dual (in a mathematical sense) to the `proc` one.
HeyVL also has dual `co`-versions of its [verification statements](#verification-statements), which will be introduced later.

Consider the following `coproc` example (with the domain declarations from above omitted):
```heyvl
coproc lossy_list_up(init_l: List) -> (l: List)
    pre 0
    post len(l)
{
    l = init_l
    @invariant(exp(0.5, len(l)))
    while len(l) > 0 {
        var prob_choice: Bool = flip(0.5)
        if prob_choice {
            l = pop(l)
        } else {
            assert [false]
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, we prove an upper bound of zero to the expected value of `len(l)` on termination.
For simplicity, we'll use [Park induction](../proof-rules/induction.md) again.

:::note

We are now using Park induction with upper bounds, which means the proof rule only gives us an upper bound to the *least fixed point* of the loop semantics.
Before, we reasoned about greatest fixed point semantics!

As we've said above, the least fixed point semantics assigns expected value **zero** to nonterminating runs (as opposed to **infinity** for greatest fixed point semantics).
Thus, now we are only proving an upper bound on the expected value of `len(l)` *only for the terminating executions AND those which do not crash*.
If we hit the `assert [false]` statement, then the expected value will be zero and those executions will verify trivially since HeyVL's expected values are always nonnegative.

Caesar has other proof rules built-in that allow reasoning about lower bounds of least fixed points and upper bounds of greatest fixed points.
See the [proof rules documentation](../proof-rules/).

:::

## Verification Statements {#verification-statements}

In addition to HeyVL's "normal" programming constructs such as assignments `x = e`, `if (b) { ... } else { ... }`, Caesar has statements that are specific to program verification.
There are `assert` statements which add proof obligations, `assume` statements which allow to add assumptions, and nondeterministic choices.

In the following, we'll explain HeyVL's verification statements by explaining how the [lossy list example](#full-example) is internally rewritten to loop-free HeyVL code with verification statements.
For reference-level documentation, refer to the [HeyVL statements documentation](../heyvl/statements.md).

:::info

Our [OOPLSA '23 publication _"A Deductive Verification Infrastructure for Probabilistic Programs"_](../publications.md#oopsla-23) ([direct link to extended version pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.07781.pdf)) is a formal treatment of HeyVL's verification statements.
It is a highly recommended read to understand HeyVL's verification statements in detail and from the bottom up.

:::

### Boolean Verification Statements

HeyVL's verification statements are quantitative generalizations of classical verification statements that can be found in deductive verifiers such as [Dafny](https://dafny.org/).
This means that when we only reason about Boolean properties, i.e. whether a property holds in certain states or not (as opposed to expected values of such predicates), then HeyVL's verification statements behave *exactly* as their qualitative (Boolean) counterparts.
This is why we'll start our explanation with non-probabilistic intuition before we delve into more detail about [*expectation-based reasoning*](#expectation-based-reasoning), the generalization to the quantitative setting.

#### Embed Expressions

An embed [expression](../heyvl/expressions.md) `?(b)` takes a Boolean expression `b` and maps it to `âˆž` if `b` evaluates to `true` and to `0` otherwise.
It can be expressed by Iverson brackets `[b]` via `[b] * âˆž`.

Thus, embed expressions *embed* Boolean expressions into the quantitative verification domain that Caesar uses where values are not just `false` and `true`, but everything from the real number `0` up to and including `âˆž`.

#### Boolean Assertions

A Boolean assertion is used to say that a predicate is true at this location.
For example,
```heyvl
assert ?(len(init_l) > 0)
```
will require that `len(init_l)` is at least one.

#### Boolean Assumptions

A Boolean assumption is used to instruct the verifier that a Boolean expression can be assumed to be true at this point without proof.
For example,
```heyvl
assume ?(len(init_l) == 1)
```
will assume that `len(init_l)` is one.
Executions that do not satisfy the Boolean expression are ignored by the verifier.

For example, consider this piece of code:
```heyvl
assume ?(len(init_l) == 1); assert ?(len(init_l) > 0)
```
The assertion will never fail since we assume in all executions that the assertion `len(init_l) == 1` is true and thus also `len(init_l) > 0` holds.

Note that `assume ?(false)` will assume `false`, i.e. everything following after this statement will verify.
