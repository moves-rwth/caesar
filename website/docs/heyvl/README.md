# HeyVL

HeyVL is a verification language similar to Viper and Boogie.
The main innovation is that it supports _quantitative_ reasoning via its constructs inspired by GÃ¶del logic.
Refer to our [publications](../publications.md) for details on the theory.

A HeyVL file consists of a sequence of declarations: [procedure](./procs.md) and [domain declarations](./domains.md).
Refer to those for more information.

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

<DocCardList />
```
