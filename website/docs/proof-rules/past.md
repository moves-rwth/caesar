# Positive Almost-Sure Termination

_Positive almost-sure termination_ (PAST for short) means that a program [terminates almost-surely](ast) and the expected runtime to termination is finite.
In terms of the [expected runtime calculus](calculi), this means that `ert[C](0) < âˆž` holds for a program `C`.

Caesar supports proofs of "PAST from Ranking Superinvariants" by [Chakarov and Sankaranarayanan (CAV 2013)](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-39799-8_34) as a built-in encoding with the `@past` annotation on `while` loops.
