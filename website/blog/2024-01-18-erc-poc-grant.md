We are happy to announce that RWTH's [MOVES group](https://moves.rwth-aachen.de/), headed by Prof. Joost-Pieter Katoen, will receive funding from the European Research Council (ERC) for a [Proof of Concept Grant](https://erc.europa.eu/apply-grant/proof-concept) to improve Caesar.

Caesar was originally built in part through [FRAPPANT](https://moves.rwth-aachen.de/research/projects/frappant/), the 2018 ERC Advanced Grant "Formal Reasoning about Probabilistic Programs: Breaking New Ground for Automation".
The new ERC Proof of Concept research proposal "A Deductive Verifier for Probabilistic Programs (VERIPROB)" is about applying knowledge from FRAPPANT to build Caesar into a prototype that can be made use of by industry &mdash; "to turn science into practice".
