Darion Haase [presented our work on slicing-based diagnostics for probabilistic program verification](https://popl26.sigplan.org/details/dafny-2026-papers/3/Diagnostics-in-Probabilistic-Program-Verification) at [Dafny 2026](https://popl26.sigplan.org/home/dafny-2026), which took place on January 11, 2026, in Rennes, France.

The presentation gave an overview of the main ideas behind our ESOP 2026 paper [_"Error Localization, Certificates, and Hints for Probabilistic Program Verification via Slicing"_](/docs/publications#esop-26-error-localization-certificates-and-hints-for-probabilistic-program-verification-via-slicing).
It gave an introduction to our three notions of slicing (error-witnessing, verification-witnessing, and verification-preserving slices) and explained how they can be used to provide useful and formally justified diagnostics for deductive verifiers like Caesar and Dafny.
